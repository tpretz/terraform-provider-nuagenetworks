Requirements
------------

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.9 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/rvichery/terraform-provider-nuagenetworks`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/rvichery/; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/rvichery
$ git clone git@github.com:rvichery/terraform-provider-nuagenetworks
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/rvichery/terraform-provider-nuagenetworks
$ make build
```

Using the provider
----------------------
If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to [install it as a plugin.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin) After placing it into your plugins directory,  run `terraform init` to initialize it.

The provider currently supports certificate based authentication only due to an issue encountered with password based authentication. 

The Nuage Networks VSP API is based on parent/child relationship. For any child resource, you can specify the parent in the resource definition with ```parent_<parent type>```, for example:

```
resource "nuagenetworks_ns_gateway" "nsgateway" {
    parent_enterprise = "${var.enterprise}"
      template_id       = "${var.template}"
        name              = "${var.name}"
}
```

Contributing
----------------------
Contribution to this provider are limited to examples and documentation as the provider is automatically generated by a custom [monolithe](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/monolithe/) generator from the VSD API specifications. The custom generator can be found [here](https://github.com/rvichery/monolithe-terraform), and contribution are more than welcome on the generator.
